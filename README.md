# Emotion-Speech-Recognition
Emotion Speech Recognition with 2 state is angry and neutral

In the project, I will create  models for recognition emotion in speech. I select 3 method is:
- KNN
- SVM 
- MLP 

to recognition angry and neutral emotion in speech  
I only run base on data with 500 files speech (2000-5000ms). Ressult of each model is:
* KNN (~ 73,4 % )
* SVM (~ 82,7 % )
* MLP (~ 78 % )

Notes: Features I use for models is 13 mfccs. Features exteacted from librosa library.
