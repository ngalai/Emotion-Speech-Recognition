# Emotion-Speech-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition with 2 emotion is angry and neutral

In the project, I will create  models for recognition emotion in speech at here I select 3 method is:
- KNN
- SVM 
- MLP 

to recognition angry and neutral emotion in speech  from audio segmentation 
I only run base on dataset with 500 files speech (2000-5000ms). Ressult of each model is:
* KNN (~ 73,4 % )
* SVM (~ 82,7 % )
* MLP (~ 78 % )

Notes: Features I use for models is 13 mfccs. Features exteacted from librosa library.
